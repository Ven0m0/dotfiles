# Disable specific checks
# SC1072-1079,1083: Various parsing issues (intentional usage)
# SC1090,1091: Can't follow non-constant source
# SC2002: Useless cat (sometimes useful for readability)
# SC2009: Consider pgrep instead of grep ps (pgrep not always available)
# SC2015: A && B || C may run C when A is true (intentional pattern)
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes (expected)
# SC2034: Unused variables (may be used externally)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (intentional)
# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned (sourced externally)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (minor)
# SC2236: Use -n/-z instead of ! -z/-n (style preference)
# SC2244: Prefer explicit -n to check non-empty string (style preference)
# SC2249: Consider adding a default case (not always needed)
# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references
# SC2310: Function invoked in condition disables set -e (expected behavior)
# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately
# SC2317: Command appears unreachable (invoked indirectly)
